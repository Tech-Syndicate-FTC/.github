# What we're doing...
After our season ending at semi-final regionals, we decided to start working on an off-season co-axial swerve drive.
We are also working on an FTC library that provides an event-loop and a command based scheduler. It also provides an abstraction layer over RoadRunner. Soon to be open-sourced.
